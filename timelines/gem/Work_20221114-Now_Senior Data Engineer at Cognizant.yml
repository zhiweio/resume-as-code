      Served as a technical lead and Senior Data Engineer for Bayer, a global life sciences client, driving digital transformation through large-scale cloud migration and the adoption of **Zero-Disk Data Architectures**. Spearheaded the design and implementation of critical data systems including Customer Data Platforms (CDP) and Master Data Management (MDM) solutions, shifting from monolithic, disk-bound legacy systems to decoupled, infinite-scale cloud storage models. Acted as the primary liaison between business stakeholders and technical teams, ensuring data integrity, scalability, and alignment with strategic business goals within the AWS and Azure ecosystems.
    achievements:
      - "Honors & Recognition: Recognized for consistent high performance and innovation in a challenging enterprise environment; awarded the 'China Region Outstanding Employee' for three consecutive years (2023, 2024, 2025) and the prestigious '2024 APAC Bluebolt Innovation Award' for delivering a breakthrough data integration solution."
      - "Cloud Migration Leadership: Faced with an aging legacy data warehouse that limited scalability and performance, led the comprehensive migration strategy to a modern AWS cloud infrastructure. Orchestrated the end-to-end migration of over 3,000 tables and 10TB+ of historical data, utilizing AWS Glue and DMS. Resulted in a 40% reduction in query latency and a 25% decrease in infrastructure maintenance costs."
      - "Lakehouse CDP Architecture: Architected a modern Lakehouse CDP separating storage and compute, featuring a Hive-style tiered data lake (Landing -> Raw Parquet) and Redshift Data Warehouse. Utilized AWS Glue Data Catalog for unified metadata management and Athena/Redshift Spectrum for seamless data lake analysis. Extended the platform to support Snowflake integration, harmonizing data from 8+ sources to empower marketing with a 360-degree customer view."
      - "Automation & Open Source Innovation: Designed a serverless Redshift cross-cluster sync system using Glue, Lambda, and S3, automating UAT data transfers and reducing manual workload by 99%. Implemented high-performance file synchronization for the CDP using Rclone; during development, debugged and identified a critical 'InvalidUTF8' issue in Rclone's source code, receiving acknowledgment from the tool's author."
      - "Team Leadership: Led and mentored a team of 4 junior and entry-level engineers, overseeing task allocation, code reviews, and technical growth, ensuring successful delivery of complex data requirements."
      - "Master Data Management System: Identified critical inconsistencies in retail master data that caused reporting errors; designed a custom MDM solution leveraging the Microsoft Power Platform and Azure Data Lake. Implemented automated data quality checks and version control workflows. Reduced data discrepancies by 95% and streamlined the data stewardship process, saving the operations team 20+ hours per week."
      - "Data Pipeline Optimization: Challenged with slow daily processing jobs that delayed business reporting, refactored core data processing workflows using advanced partitioning and caching strategies in Databricks. Reduced daily processing time from 6 hours to 2.5 hours, ensuring 99.9% data availability and timely insights for decision-making."
