      Architected and developed a comprehensive Retail Master Data Management System leveraging the Microsoft Power Platform ecosystem to centralize and govern retail data assets. The solution integrated Power Apps (Model-driven & Canvas), Dataverse, and Azure Cloud Services (Storage, Synapse Analytics) to replace fragmented Excel-based workflows with a robust, version-controlled, and scalable platform. It bridged the gap between operational data entry and analytical data lakes, ensuring data consistency and accessibility for store managers and operations teams.
    achievements:
      - "**Enterprise Low-Code Architecture**: Designed and deployed a multi-environment (DEV/UAT/PROD) Power Platform solution on Azure China. Implemented Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) strategies using Power Platform Pipelines and GitHub Actions to manage solution promotion and ensure governance across environments."
      - "**Billion-Scale Data Architecture with Cosmos DB**: Designed a high-performance storage layer using Azure Cosmos DB partitioned by data version to support massive historical data retention. Leveraged Cosmos DB's horizontal scaling to manage billions of records, ensuring sub-second response times for current state queries while maintaining a complete audit trail of historical versions for rollback capabilities."
      - "**Advanced Custom PCF Controls**: Engineered high-performance React/TypeScript component using Fluent UI v8. This control extended Model-driven App capabilities with features like Excel-like grid editing, client-side file parsing (`xlsx`), bulk data validation, and granular version history management."
      - "**Metadata-Driven 'Zero Code' Framework**: Engineered a dynamic, configuration-based application framework to eliminate development bottlenecks. Utilized Dataverse as a metadata repository where frontend applications and backend Dataflow ETL jobs dynamically fetch schema definitions via OData APIs, enabling the creation and modification of tables purely through configuration without code deployment."
      - "**Automated ETL & Dataflow Engineering**: Developed a Python-based CLI tool (`generate_dataflows.py`) utilizing Jinja2 templates to auto-generate complex Power Query (M) scripts. This automation standardized the ETL logic for batch data ingestion, incremental updates, and rollbacks, significantly reducing manual maintenance overhead."
      - "**Cross-Cloud Data Synchronization**: Established a robust data bridge between Azure operational systems and AWS analytical warehouses to unify data across a multi-cloud landscape. Implemented real-time incremental synchronization from Dataverse to Azure Data Lake Gen2 via Synapse Link, and developed custom adapters to integrate with AWS Data Warehouse pipelines, ensuring data consistency across cloud boundaries."
      - "**Security & Compliance**: Enforced a Zero Trust security model using Azure RBAC, Storage Firewalls, and Dataverse Security Roles. Implemented custom SAS token generation logic to secure browser-based storage access, ensuring strict data isolation and compliance with enterprise security standards."
      - "**High-Performance ETL & Ingestion Pipeline**: Optimized data ingestion pipelines to overcome OData API throughput limitations, reducing data load times for massive datasets. Transitioned from row-by-row processing to a bulk load architecture using Azure Blob Storage and parallelized Dataflows, achieving a 30x performance gain (increasing throughput from 3MB/s to over 100MB/s)."
