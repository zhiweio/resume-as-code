      Architected and delivered an enterprise-grade Retail Master Data Management (MDM) platform to centralize fragmented retail data, replacing manual Excel workflows with a governed, version-controlled system. The solution leveraged a hybrid architecture of Microsoft Power Platform (Model-driven Apps, PCF) and Azure Cosmos DB to handle billion-scale datasets with high performance. By implementing a metadata-driven design and cross-cloud synchronization, the platform bridged operational data entry with analytical reporting in AWS and Azure, ensuring data consistency and near real-time availability across the retail ecosystem.
    achievements:
      - "**Billion-Scale Data Architecture with Cosmos DB**: Designed a high-performance storage layer using Azure Cosmos DB partitioned by data version to support massive historical data retention. Leveraged Cosmos DB's horizontal scaling to manage billions of records, ensuring sub-second response times for current state queries while maintaining a complete audit trail of historical versions for rollback capabilities."
      - "**Metadata-Driven 'Zero Code' Framework**: Engineered a dynamic, configuration-based application framework to eliminate development bottlenecks. Utilized Dataverse as a metadata repository where frontend applications and backend Dataflow ETL jobs dynamically fetch schema definitions via OData APIs, enabling the creation and modification of tables purely through configuration without code deployment."
      - "**Cross-Cloud Real-Time Data Synchronization**: Established a robust data bridge between Azure operational systems and AWS analytical warehouses to unify data across a multi-cloud landscape. Implemented real-time incremental synchronization from Dataverse to Azure Data Lake Gen2 via Synapse Link, and developed custom adapters to integrate with AWS Data Warehouse pipelines, ensuring data consistency across cloud boundaries."
      - "**Granular Security & Governance Model**: Implemented a comprehensive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system to enforce strict data governance. Leveraged Dataverse Security Roles for fine-grained table-level permissions, allowing administrators to manage user access and authorization through simple configuration interfaces rather than complex code."
      - "**Advanced PCF Controls for Data Operations**: Developed sophisticated custom Power Apps Component Framework (PCF) controls (`DataPortalControl`) using React, TypeScript, and Fluent UI v8. Provided a seamless, Excel-like user experience for complex bulk operations, featuring client-side Excel parsing (`xlsx`), secure direct-to-blob uploads via SAS tokens, and intuitive UI for data rollback and history inspection."
      - "**High-Performance ETL & Ingestion Pipeline**: Optimized data ingestion pipelines to overcome OData API throughput limitations, reducing data load times for massive datasets. Transitioned from row-by-row processing to a bulk load architecture using Azure Blob Storage and parallelized Dataflows, achieving a 30x performance gain (increasing throughput from 3MB/s to over 100MB/s)."
