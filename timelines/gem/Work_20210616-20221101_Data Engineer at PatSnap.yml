      Served as a core Big Data Developer for the TFFI (Technology & Innovation Finance) SaaS product, architecting and implementing data solutions for millions of technology enterprises and 180 million global patent records. Responsible for the end-to-end design of real-time and offline data warehouses, ensuring high-performance data processing and stability for front-end search and analytical reporting. Led the technical delivery and localization of data systems for over 10 major banking and government clients, driving the adoption of data-driven financial solutions.
    achievements:
      - "High-Performance Spark Diff Engine: Faced with the challenge of synchronizing over 500 million daily analysis records to the TiDB warehouse without overwhelming the cluster, designed and developed a custom Spark Diff library. This solution supported complex nested structures and various formats (Athena, Parquet, CSV), achieving minute-level processing for hundreds of millions of rows (e.g., 2 minutes for 100M+ records). This innovation ensured efficient incremental updates and significantly reduced load on the production database."
      - "Real-time Data Warehouse Architecture: To provide up-to-the-minute insights on enterprise financing and business status, built a real-time wide table system using Flink, Kafka, and TiCDC. Overcame a critical compatibility blocker between Flink 1.12 and TiCDC 5.1 by analyzing the source code and patching the `flink-format-maxwell` component, adding custom filtering capabilities. This ensured seamless real-time data ingestion into TiDB."
      - "SaaS Data Infrastructure & Analytics: Architected a scalable data lake solution on AWS S3 and Athena to handle 1.8 billion global patents. Orchestrated complex Spark jobs via DolphinScheduler on AWS EMR to compute patent value distributions and tags. This infrastructure supported TB-scale data processing, enabling the generation of high-value financial reports and risk analysis for the SaaS platform."
      - "Automated Delivery System (Guardian): Addressed the inefficiency of deploying updates to isolated, secure client environments (banks/government) by developing 'Guardian,' a custom continuous delivery tool based on webhooks. Integrated this with GitLab CI/CD pipelines to automate Docker image building, MinIO file synchronization, and application rolling upgrades. This reduced delivery costs and improved deployment reliability across 10+ localized projects."
      - "Client Delivery & Recognition: Successfully led the independent delivery and maintenance of complex data projects for high-profile clients including the Agricultural Bank of China (Suzhou, Hubei, Wuhan branches) and the Bank of Jiangsu. Recognized for technical excellence and impact with the '2021 Star Engineer' award."
