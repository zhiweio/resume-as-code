      Architected and engineered the Bayer Customer Data Platform (CDP), a mission-critical, cloud-native ecosystem designed to unify fragmented customer data across the enterprise. The solution integrated heterogeneous data sources—including internal legacy systems (MedicalHub, Obito, Opera) and external SaaS platforms (Databricks, Salesforce, AliHealth)—into a centralized data lakehouse. This initiative established a "Single Source of Truth" for customer interactions, enabling advanced analytics, personalized marketing, and data-driven decision-making at scale.
    achievements:
      - "**Infrastructure as Code & DevOps Maturity**: Established a robust, repeatable infrastructure foundation to eliminate configuration drift and accelerate deployment cycles. Designed a modular Terraform architecture to provision AWS resources (Lambda, Glue, Step Functions, RDS, IAM) and implemented comprehensive CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions, reducing deployment time by 60% and ensuring 99.9% infrastructure uptime."
      - "**High-Performance Salesforce Integration**: Engineered a custom, high-throughput integration layer to overcome standard API rate limits and latency issues. Developed a specialized Python SDK for Salesforce Bulk API 2.0 featuring dynamic file chunking and parallel processing, enabling the reliable daily synchronization of over 10 million records and contributing performance optimizations back to the open-source `simple-salesforce` community."
      - "**Event-Driven Data Orchestration**: Designed a resilient, serverless orchestration workflow to manage complex dependencies between disparate data sources. Utilized AWS Step Functions and EventBridge to coordinate ETL jobs across MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and SFTP servers, implementing automated retries and dead-letter queues (DLQ) to handle failures gracefully and ensure data consistency."
      - "**Scalable Serverless ETL Architecture**: Implemented a cost-effective, auto-scaling data processing pipeline to handle fluctuating data volumes without over-provisioning. Leveraged AWS Glue for heavy-lifting Spark jobs and AWS Lambda for lightweight transformations, optimizing compute costs by 40% while maintaining strict SLAs for data freshness."
      - "**Security, Compliance & Governance**: Enforced enterprise-grade security standards to protect sensitive PII and PHI data in compliance with GDPR and industry regulations. Implemented KMS for encryption at rest and in transit, fine-grained IAM roles for least-privilege access, and AWS CloudTrail for comprehensive audit logging, ensuring zero security incidents during the project lifecycle."
      - "**Cross-Functional Leadership & Knowledge Transfer**: Bridged the gap between technical engineering and business strategy to ensure the platform delivered tangible value. Collaborated with data scientists to define schema requirements for predictive modeling and conducted technical workshops to upskill the internal team on cloud-native best practices, fostering a culture of engineering excellence."
      - "**Strategic Business Impact**: Unlocked the value of siloed data to drive business growth and operational efficiency. The unified CDP enabled a 360-degree customer view, empowering marketing teams to launch targeted campaigns that increased engagement rates by 25% and providing leadership with real-time dashboards for strategic planning."
